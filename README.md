The Pictures ideally would be hosted in a cloud somewhere with links to access them as an imagePath key stored with the items in Firebase.

I did have the time to go through the pain of hosting them in the cloud.

I also was told I couldn't modify the items list in firebase.

Because of those limitation the pictures are coded the way they are.
